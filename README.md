# OpenLineage Docs

This repo is primarily for serving website, blogs and docs. 
It contains containing versioned docs both for latest and earlier releases of OpenLineage. 

If you want to contribute to the docs for the new release, write a blog, add something to the 
website, the best way to do this is https://github.com/OpenLineage/OpenLineage/tree/main/website

Contributing directly to `openlineage-site` makes sense only if you want to fixup something in the
older docs release.
